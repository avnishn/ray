    Execution plans are not a "core" concept for users. Sample batches should probably also be left out.

.. _rllib-core-concepts:

Key Concepts
============

On this page, we'll cover the key concepts to help you understand how RLlib works and how to use it.
In RLlib you use `trainers` to train `algorithms`.
These algorithms use `policies` to select actions for your agents.
Given a policy, `evaluation` of a policy produces `sample batches` of experiences.
You can also customize the `execution plans` of your RL experiments.

Trainers
--------

Trainers bring all RLlib components together, making algorithms accessible via RLlib's Python API and its command line interface (CLI).
They manage algorithm configuration, setup of the rollout workers and optimizer, and collection of training metrics.
Trainers also implement the :ref:`Tune Trainable API <tune-60-seconds>` for easy experiment management.

You have three ways to interact with a trainer. You can use the basic Python API or the command line to train it, or you
can use Ray Tune to tune hyperparameters of your reinforcement learning algorithm.
The following example shows three equivalent ways of interacting with the ``PPO`` Trainer,
which implements the proximal policy optimization algorithm in RLlib.

.. tabbed:: Basic RLlib Trainer

    .. code-block:: python

        trainer = PPO(env="CartPole-v0", config={"train_batch_size": 4000})
        while True:
            print(trainer.train())

.. tabbed:: RLlib Command Line

    .. code-block:: bash

        rllib train --run=PPO --env=CartPole-v0 --config='{"train_batch_size": 4000}'

.. tabbed:: RLlib Tune Trainer

    .. code-block:: python

        from ray import tune
        tune.run(PPO, config={"env": "CartPole-v0", "train_batch_size": 4000})



RLlib `Trainer classes <rllib-concepts.html#trainers>`__ coordinate the distributed workflow of running rollouts and optimizing policies.
Trainer classes leverage parallel iterators to implement the desired computation pattern.
The following figure shows *synchronous sampling*, the simplest of `these patterns <rllib-algorithms.html>`__:

.. figure:: images/a2c-arch.svg

    Synchronous Sampling (e.g., A2C, PG, PPO)

RLlib uses `Ray actors <actors.html>`__ to scale training from a single core to many thousands of cores in a cluster.
You can `configure the parallelism <rllib-training.html#specifying-resources>`__ used for training by changing the ``num_workers`` parameter.
Check out our `scaling guide <rllib-training.html#scaling-guide>`__ for more details here.


Policies
--------

`Policies <rllib-concepts.html#policies>`__ are a core concept in RLlib. In a nutshell, policies are
Python classes that define how an agent acts in an environment.
`Rollout workers <rllib-concepts.html#policy-evaluation>`__ query the policy to determine agent actions.
In a `gym <rllib-env.html#openai-gym>`__ environment, there is a single agent and policy.
In `vector envs <rllib-env.html#vectorized>`__, policy inference is for multiple agents at once,
and in `multi-agent <rllib-env.html#multi-agent-and-hierarchical>`__, there may be multiple policies,
each controlling one or more agents:

.. image:: images/multi-flat.svg

Policies can be implemented using `any framework <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/policy/policy.py>`__.
However, for TensorFlow and PyTorch, RLlib has
`build_tf_policy <rllib-concepts.html#building-policies-in-tensorflow>`__ and
`build_torch_policy <rllib-concepts.html#building-policies-in-pytorch>`__ helper functions that let you
define a trainable policy with a functional-style API, for example:

.. TODO: test this code snippet

.. code-block:: python

  def policy_gradient_loss(policy, model, dist_class, train_batch):
      logits, _ = model.from_batch(train_batch)
      action_dist = dist_class(logits, model)
      return -tf.reduce_mean(
          action_dist.logp(train_batch["actions"]) * train_batch["rewards"])

  # <class 'ray.rllib.policy.tf_policy_template.MyTFPolicy'>
  MyTFPolicy = build_tf_policy(
      name="MyTFPolicy",
      loss_fn=policy_gradient_loss)


Policy Evaluation
-----------------

Given an environment and policy, policy evaluation produces `batches <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/policy/sample_batch.py>`__ of experiences. This is your classic "environment interaction loop". Efficient policy evaluation can be burdensome to get right, especially when leveraging vectorization, RNNs, or when operating in a multi-agent environment. RLlib provides a `RolloutWorker <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py>`__ class that manages all of this, and this class is used in most RLlib algorithms.

You can use rollout workers standalone to produce batches of experiences. This can be done by calling ``worker.sample()`` on a worker instance, or ``worker.sample.remote()`` in parallel on worker instances created as Ray actors (see `WorkerSet <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/evaluation/worker_set.py>`__).

Here is an example of creating a set of rollout workers and using them gather experiences in parallel. The trajectories are concatenated, the policy learns on the trajectory batch, and then we broadcast the policy weights to the workers for the next round of rollouts:

.. code-block:: python

    # Setup policy and rollout workers.
    env = gym.make("CartPole-v0")
    policy = CustomPolicy(env.observation_space, env.action_space, {})
    workers = WorkerSet(
        policy_class=CustomPolicy,
        env_creator=lambda c: gym.make("CartPole-v0"),
        num_workers=10)

    while True:
        # Gather a batch of samples.
        T1 = SampleBatch.concat_samples(
            ray.get([w.sample.remote() for w in workers.remote_workers()]))

        # Improve the policy using the T1 batch.
        policy.learn_on_batch(T1)

        # The local worker acts as a "parameter server" here.
        # We put the weights of its `policy` into the Ray object store once (`ray.put`)...
        weights = ray.put({"default_policy": policy.get_weights()})
        for w in workers.remote_workers():
            # ... so that we can broacast these weights to all rollout-workers once.
            w.set_weights.remote(weights)

Sample Batches
--------------

Whether running in a single process or a `large cluster <rllib-training.html#specifying-resources>`__,
all data in RLlib is interchanged in the form of `sample batches <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/policy/sample_batch.py>`__.
Sample batches encode one or more fragments of a trajectory.
Typically, RLlib collects batches of size ``rollout_fragment_length`` from rollout workers, and concatenates one or
more of these batches into a batch of size ``train_batch_size`` that is the input to SGD.

A typical sample batch looks something like the following when summarized.
Since all values are kept in arrays, this allows for efficient encoding and transmission across the network:

.. code-block:: python

    sample_batch = { 'action_logp': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=float32, min=-0.701, max=-0.685, mean=-0.694),
        'actions': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=int64, min=0.0, max=1.0, mean=0.495),
        'dones': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=bool, min=0.0, max=1.0, mean=0.055),
        'infos': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=object, head={}),
        'new_obs': np.ndarray((200, 4), dtype=float32, min=-2.46, max=2.259, mean=0.018),
        'obs': np.ndarray((200, 4), dtype=float32, min=-2.46, max=2.259, mean=0.016),
        'rewards': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=float32, min=1.0, max=1.0, mean=1.0),
        't': np.ndarray((200,), dtype=int64, min=0.0, max=34.0, mean=9.14)
    }

In `multi-agent mode <rllib-concepts.html#policies-in-multi-agent>`__,
sample batches are collected separately for each individual policy.
These batches are wrapped up together in a ``MultiAgentBatch``,
serving as a container for the individual agents' sample batches.


Training Iteration Functions
----------------------------

.. TODO all four execution plan snippets below must be tested
.. note::
    It's important to have a good understanding of the basic :ref:`ray core functions <core-walkthrough>` before reading this section.
    Furthermore, we utilize concepts such as the ``SampleBatch``, ``RolloutWorker``, and ``Trainer``, which can be read about on this page
    and the :ref:`rollout worker reference docs <rolloutworker-reference-docs>`.

    Finally, users who are looking to implement custom algorithms should familiarize themselves with the :ref:`Policy <rllib-policy-walkthrough>` and
    :ref:`Model <rllib-models-walkthrough>` classes.

What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``training_iteration`` function is an attribute of ``Trainer`` that dictates the execution of your algorithm. Specifically, it is used to express how you want to
coordinate the movement of samples and policy data across your distributed workers.

**A user will need to modify this attribute of an algorithm if they want to
make some custom changes to an algorithm or write their own from scratch if they are implementing a new algorithm.**

When is it invoked?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``training_iteration`` is called in 2 ways:

 1. The ``train()`` function of ``Trainer`` is called.
 2. An RLlib trainer is being used with ray tune and ``training_iteration`` will be continuously called till the
    :ref:`ray tune stop criteria <tune-run-ref>` is met.

Key Subconcepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The vanilla policy gradient algorithm can be thought of a sequence of repeating steps, or *dataflow*, of:

 1. Generating experiences from many envs in parallel using rollout workers.
 2. Update our policy using the experiences generated in the previous step.
 3. Update the weights of our rollout workers using the updated policy.

.. code-block:: python

    def training_iteration(self) -> ResultDict:
        # type: SampleBatchType
        train_batch = synchronous_parallel_sample(
                        worker_set=self.workers,
                        max_env_steps=self.config["train_batch_size"]
                    )

        # type: ResultDict
        train_results = train_one_step(self, train_batch)

        # Update worker weights with the weights from the trained
        # policy on the local worker.
        self.workers.sync_weights()

        return train_results

.. note::
    Note that the training iteration function is framework agnostic. This means that you don’t need to implement torch
    or tensorflow code inside this module. This allows the training iteration function / algorithm to support different frameworks.
    Within the :ref:`Policy <rllib-policy-walkthrough>` and :ref:`Model <rllib-models-walkthrough>` classes, we leverage the
    framework-specific operations and modules.

Breaking that ``training_iteration`` code down:

.. code-block:: python

    train_batch = synchronous_parallel_sample(
                        worker_set=self.workers,
                        max_env_steps=self.config["train_batch_size"]
                    )

``self.workers`` is a set of ``RolloutWorkers`` that are created for developers in ``Trainer``'s ``setup`` method.
This set is covered in greater depth on the :ref:`WorkerSet documentation page<workerset-reference-docs>`.
The function ``synchronous_parallel_sample`` is an RLlib utility that can be used for sampling in a blocking parallel
fashion across multiple rollout workers. RLlib includes other utilities, such as the ``AsyncRequestsManager``, for
facilitating the dataflow between various components in parallelizable fashion. They are covered in the :ref:`parallel requests documentation <parallel-requests-docs>`

.. code-block:: python

    train_results = train_one_step(self, train_batch)

Functions like ``train_one_step`` and ``multi_gpu_train_one_step`` can be used for

.. code-block:: python

    self.workers.sync_weights()

As you can see each call to ``training_iteration`` does one sampling and training update. A dictionary is a returned that contains the results of the training update.
It's generally recommended that the dictionary map keys of type ``str`` to values that are of type ``float`` or to dictionaries of the same form, allowing for a nested structure.

Training Iteration Function Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib provides a collection of utilities that abstract away common tasks in RL training.

**Sample Batches** (`sample_batch.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/policy/sample_batch.py>`__):
``SampleBatch`` and `MultiAgentBatch` are the two datatypes that we use for containing timesteps in RLlib. All of our
RLlib abstractions (policies, replay buffers, etc.) operate using these types.

**Rollout Workers** (`rollout_worker.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py>`__):
Rollout workers are an abstraction that wrap a policy (or policies in the case of multi-agent) and an environment.
From a high-level, we can use rollout workers to collect experiences from the environment by calling
their ``sample`` function and we can train their policies by calling their ``learn_on_batch`` function.
By default in RLlib we create a set of workers that can be used for sampling and training. We create a ``WorkerSet``
object inside of ``setup`` which is called when an RLlib algorithm is created. The ``WorkerSet`` has a ``local_worker``
and ``remote_workers`` if ``num_workers > 0`` in the experiment config. In RLlib we use typically use ``local_worker``
for training and ``remote_workers`` for sampling.


**Train ops** (`train_ops.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/execution/train_ops.py>`__):
These are functions that improve the policy and update workers. The most basic operator, ``train_one_step``, take in as input a batch of experiences and emit metrics as output.
For training with gpus, use ``multi_gpu_train_one_step``. These functions use the ``learn_on_batch`` function of rollout workers to complete the training update.

**Replay Buffers**:
RLlib provides `a collection <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib/utils/replay_buffers>`__ of replay buffers that can be used for storing and sampling experiences.

**Concurrency ops**:
RLlib provides a collection of concurrency ops that can be asynchronous and synchronous operations in the training loop.
``AsyncRequestsManager`` is used for launching and managing asynchronous requests on actors. Currently in RLlib it is
used for asynchronous sampling on rollout workers and asynchronously adding to and sampling from replay buffer actors.
``synchronous_parallel_sample`` has a more narrow but common ussage of synchronously sampling from a set of rollout workers.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. dropdown::  **Example: Synchronous Policy-Gradients**

    This is what the Vanilla Policy Gradients algorithm looks like:

    .. code-block:: python

            def training_iteration(self) -> ResultDict:
                # Collect SampleBatches from sample workers until we have a full batch.
                if self._by_agent_steps:
                    train_batch = synchronous_parallel_sample(
                        worker_set=self.workers,
                        max_agent_steps=self.config["train_batch_size"]
                    )
                else:
                    train_batch = synchronous_parallel_sample(
                        worker_set=self.workers,
                        max_env_steps=self.config["train_batch_size"]
                    )
                train_batch = train_batch.as_multi_agent()
                self._counters[NUM_AGENT_STEPS_SAMPLED] += train_batch.agent_steps()
                self._counters[NUM_ENV_STEPS_SAMPLED] += train_batch.env_steps()

                # Use simple optimizer (only for non-gpu cases; all other
                # cases should use the multi-GPU optimizer, even if only using 1 GPU).
                if self.config.get("simple_optimizer") is True:
                    train_results = train_one_step(self, train_batch)
                else:
                    train_results = multi_gpu_train_one_step(self, train_batch)

                # Update weights and global_vars - after learning on the local worker
                # - on all remote workers.
                global_vars = {
                    "timestep": self._counters[NUM_ENV_STEPS_SAMPLED],
                }
                with self._timers[WORKER_UPDATE_TIMER]:
                    self.workers.sync_weights(global_vars=global_vars)

                return train_results

                # Shortcut.
